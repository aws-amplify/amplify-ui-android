Amplify UI for Kotlin is an open-source UI library with components that are endlessly customizable, accessible, and can integrate into _any_ Kotlin application. Amplify UI consists of:

1. Connected components that simplify complex cloud-connected workflows, like Authenticator.
2. Primitive components that create consistency across Amplify UI and allow you to build complete applications that fit your brand, like Buttons and Badges.
3. Theming capabilities that allow you to customize the appearance of Amplify UI to match your brand.
