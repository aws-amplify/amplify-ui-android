# Face Liveness

Amplify UI Face Liveness provides a UI component (FaceLivenessDetector) that helps developers deter fraud and scams during face-based identity checks by validating that users are physically present in front of the camera at that moment, and not an imposter spoofing the user's face.

More information on setting up and using the FaceLivenessDetector is in the [Amplify UI Face Liveness documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/android/connected-components/liveness).
